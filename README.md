# AnalysisResults
A repo full of analyses including results. Please work in your own subdirectory per analysis! When you write a paper about this work, please contact the DCC for a separate repository that completely reproduces (the quantitative parts of) your paper! These analyses are meant to be exploratory, or small parts of larger projects that you want to keep or showcase.

When you create a directory with your own analysis, please try to adhere to these guidelines:
- Include the directory and a brief explanation below.
- As much as possible, use code from the other repositories for loading and cleaning data. If the code you use is not in there yet, discuss with the DCC team whether it should be included there!
